# 8 Puzzle Interface (PHP Implementation)

Note: This repo consists primarily of the interface and scrambling functions of an 8 puzzle. It does NOT contain a function to solve the puzzle.

# About

This is a simple 8 puzzle game using Javascript to store cookies with a PHP model. The beginning state is already solved. It includes a button to scramble the squares and have the puzzle appear when you open the page. You are able to reset the puzzle to a random puzzle whenever the scramble button is pushed. This project uses PHP sessions to communicate information to and from the view.
